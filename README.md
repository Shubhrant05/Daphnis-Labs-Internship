<h1> My Contributions At Daphnis Labs </h1>
<h3>1. Heatmap Development</h3>

As a part of great team I got a chance to create , which I should call the toughest feature of my dev life , a feature that creates a "heatmap" of each mouse click , mouse move and other activities  that we do on a website. The feature is created for the benefits of regular user of Shopify and is added to a listed app of Shopify Store.<br/><br/>
It helps the users to keep a track of what their buyers are more intrested in and give them good insights of what the buyers are more curious about.<br/><br/>
The feature is implemented using a third party library "HEATMAP.JS" which is NOT actually made for this use but using plain Javascript I have molded it to plot the exact heatmap that was required by the app.<br/><br/>
Using this technique and several other optimisation I have reduce the time taken for creating heatmap from around ~15min to ~1 sec. Currently it is capable of pltting almost 200,000 points in ~1 sec.
