<h1> My Contributions At Daphnis Labs </h1>
<h3>1. Heatmap Development</h3>

As a part of great team I got a chance to create , which I should call the toughest feature of my dev life , a feature that creates a "heatmap" of each mouse click , mouse move and other activities  that we do on a website. The feature is created for the benefits of regular user of Shopify and is added to a listed app of Shopify Store.<br/><br/>
It helps the users to keep a track of what their buyers are more intrested in and give them good insights of what the buyers are more curious about.<br/><br/>
The feature is implemented using a third party library "HEATMAP.JS" which is NOT actually made for this use but using plain Javascript I have molded it to plot the exact heatmap that was required by the app.<br/><br/>
Using this technique and several other optimisation I have reduce the time taken for creating heatmap from around ~15min to ~1 sec. Currently it is capable of pltting almost 200,000 points in ~1 sec. <br/>
<br/>
Also the data-points are normalized to be represented on all screen sizes

The Heatmap.js library uses 4 agruements as input as a object which are<br/>
{ <br/>
  x : x-coordinate<br/>
  y : y-coordinate<br/>
  value : value of colors to be used<br/>
  radius : radius of each data-point<br/>
}<br/>

<h3>2. Session Recording </h3>

The second most difficult yet very interesting task which I would like to mention is the implementation of session recording player. As a e-commerce website owner it is always insightful for you to know what your customer really cares about. So I designed this awesome feature which helps us in a very easy and subtle way of displaying session recording.<br><br/>
I implenmented this feature using another third party library called rrweb-player . It is quite difficult to implemnt this in a NextJS app as it is not designed to be used in that way. But currently it is all good and working
